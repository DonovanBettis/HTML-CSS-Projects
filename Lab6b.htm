<p><img src="Images/DavisShout.jpg" alt="Anthony Davis shouting" /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Anthony Davis has had undeniable potential since he was a college star at the University of Kentucky. He went on to become the first overall draft pick in the 2012 NBA draft and has had a solid but somewhat rocky career with injuries. During his first year in the NBA he didn't live up to the hype that was surrounding him but all of that changed very quickly.<br /><br /><br /><br />In just his second year in the NBA Anthony Davis averaged <i>20.8 pts, 10.1 rbg, 2.8 bpg </i>these were amazing numbers for just a 20 year old and all of the hype came right back to him. He has been named an NBA All-Star in eight of his ten years in the league. He even won an All-Star Game MVP. He has many other accolades from All-NBA First Team to NBA Blocks Leader, not to forget he is also a NBA champion.<br /><br /><br /><br />Linked here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/kGFHdjdjGZ4">short video</a> of his top 25 plays from his career.</p>

Although Davis had still hadn't won a champtionship at this time, the entire lague saw his skill and potential and it's safe to say he was quickly on a rise to becoming one of the greats. <br /><br /><br /><br />During this season he averaged <i>28.1 ppg, 11.1 rbg, 2.3 apg, 2.6 bpg, 53% fg.</i> This would be considered by many, his breakout year as this would also be the year he led the Pelicans to the playoffs. Despite losing in the second round, Davis had outstanding numbers each and every game. This is the time when the NBA fans and players would begin saying he should leave New Orleans, these are words he would soon listen to.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <a href="https://youtu.be/DXN_0UpH0sw">Here</a> is a video of his highlights from this season.</p>

Together they would be a great one-two punch so to speak. Fans were extremely excited to see both of these amazing talents on the same team and would speculate how much they would win.<br /><br /><br /><br />However, just like Lebrons journey, they wouldn't win theirfirst yeaqr together, but they made a great run and showed everyone how much potential they had and there was no ceiling for them. The second year in Los Angeles everything Davis hoped and worked for would come true. He would play an amazing season averaging <i> 26.1 ppg, 9.3 rbg, 3.2 apg, 2.3 bpg, 50% fg.</i> Davis would go on to winning his first NBA championship this year as well, a huge accolade for him and his career.<br /><br /><br />Things would fall quickly however, the following season and every season after Davis has struggles to remain healthy. He's slowly becoming known as the player who is always hurt, which isn't a good thing for him or his career of being a dominant player. <br /><br /><br /> Once again here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/iGhysBxaa2Q">video</a> of his best plays for this season.</p>

<h2>Lebron James Top 3 Seasons</h2>



<h1><br /><br /><span>Overview</span></h1>

<p><img src="Images/LebronNum1.jpg" alt="Lebron James raising 1 finger" /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Many people Lebron James is the BEST NBA player of all time. I would have to agree, he has been an unstoppable force from the moment he entered the league. He has broken so many records and raised the bar for modern day basketball higher than its ever been before. He is truly a once in a lifetime player and watching him play is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Fast-forward 20 years and he's still dominating the league. During his 20 year run in the league he has managed to win Rookie of The Year, four MVP awards, four championships, four Finals MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. He is still active as of today in the NBA playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.<br /><br /><br /><br />Linked here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoMl--88TFY">video</a> of some of the best plays throughout his extensive career.</p>





<h1><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span>2011-2012 Season</span></h1>

<p><img src ="Images/Lebron2012.jpg" alt= "Lebron holding finals MVP award" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The 2011-12 NBA Season for Lebron was one for the fans to always remember. This was a huge year for Lebron himself. After years of coming up short on winning the championship, Lebron made the decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2010 and join Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami. This move schocked the entire NBA and even had Cleveland fans burning his jerseys out in the middle of the street. The decision to leave and join a "superteam" was hated even more by fans when they lost their first year together. <br /><br /><br /><br />All of the hate would change the 2nd year (2011-12) when Lebron completely dominated every team in the NBA with his star teammates to win his first NBA champtionship. During the season he avergaed <i>27.1 ppg, 7.9 rbg, 6.2 apg, 1.9 spg, 53% fg. </i>Night in and night out he went on a tear, it's safe to say this was the year he fully embraced his skillset and tookover whenever he thought it was necessary.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <a href="https://youtu.be/R2q9V40cLkA">Here</a> is a video of his top 10 plays from this season.</p>

This season would be considered by many Lebrons best season yet at this time, this would also be the year he proved everyone wrong by playing better than he ever had before. People always thought the first ring he won was by pure luck, until he won another one this year. People had no choice but to respect and praise his talent and love for the game. <br /><br /><br /><br />Playing with Bosh and Wade once again, who might I add were playing some of the best basketball they've played in their career. Lebron still managed to average <i>26.8 ppg, 8.0 rbg, 7.3 apg, 1.7 spg, 57% fg. </i> At this time analysts were having daily debates about Lebron becoming the greatest player of all time, most people still felt like he hasn't quite earned that title just yet but he was well on his way.<br /><br /><br />I also would like to mention that he was given the Finals MVP award both of these years and he was also named MVP as well for the fourth time in the last five years. Which speaks volumes to his dominance in the NBA during this era.<br /><br /><br /> Once again here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/PXDSpGakE2o">video</a> of his best plays for this season.</p>

<p><img src="Images/LebronCavs.jpg" alt="Lebron Holding Trophy" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The following year Lebron would still be in Miami where they would break their winning streak and he would make the decision to move back to his hometown team of Cleveland. He would play alongside Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving who were considered two of the best in the league during this time, so its safe to say it was another "superteam" behind him. However, the first year together they would come up short, just like he did his first year in Miami.<br /><br /><br /><br />The following year Lebron would go on a tear once again averaging <i>25.3 ppg, 7.4 rbg, 6.8 apg, 1.4 spg, 52% fg. </i>People will always acknowledge that he would have a lot of help from Irving but this team was led by Lebron without a doubt. They would go on to defeat the Warriors in one of the best and most entertaining NBA Finals of all time.The Warriors and Cavaliers would go on to face each other another 2 straight years, Lebron losing in both.<br /><br /><br /> Here is a short <a href="https://youtu.be/bl3JCYxLvDI">video</a> of his highlights from this season.</p>

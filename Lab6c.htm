<h2>Stephen Curry Top 3 Seasons</h2>



<h1><br /><br /><span>Overview</span></h1>

<p><img src="Images/CurryOpenArms.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry Holding His Arms up" /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Stephen Curry has been solidifying himself as one of the greatest basketball players the NBA has ever seen over the 14 years he's been active in the league. You can confidently say that he has forever changed the game of basketball by mostly by himself. He is the greatest shooter to ever play in the NBA, and i believe most people would agree with that statement.<br /><br /> Although he only stand at 6'2", he makes an impact on teh court every single night. The further his career goes, the more creative we see him become by adding the ability to get to the rim and finish, to becoming a solid defender.<br /><br /><br />He has managed to pull in some impressive accolades such as winning four NBA championships, two MVP awards, one Finals MVP award, two NBA Scoring Titles, he's also leades the NBA for All-Time 3pm!<br /><br /><br />There is so much to say about him but instead, here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/0eG-Dm2PtpE">short video</a> of some great moments he's had in the league.</p>

<p><img src ="Images/CurryHouston.jpg" alt= "Curry Dribbling a baskeball" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Stephen Currys break out year would have to be the 2014-15 season. This nwould be the year he showed the entire league just how good he really was despite everyone that labeled him as being "just a shooter." This season Curry would go on to win his first MVP award by unanimous vote, which is something that has never been done before and I have a feeling it's going to be a long time until we see it again. He also led the Golden State Warriors to win their first NBA championship since 1975, this also being Currys first championship for himself.<br /><br /><br /><br />This season Curry single-handedly chnaged the game of basketball as we knew it, he's such a great shooter everyone from college, to high school, all the way down to kids were trying to be as good of a shooter as he was. He managed to average <i>23.8 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 7.7 apg, 48% fg, 44% 3p.</i><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Although there were so many highlights from this season I think this <a href="https://youtu.be/BJ49oFHyZ94">video</a> shows his top 10 plays from this season.</p>

<p><img src ="Images/CurryFinger.jpg" alt= "Curry Raising his finger" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />After Curry won his first championship he would then go on to lose the following year, and course all of the doubt that he would ever win again came with that loss. He went back to being labeled "just a shooter" and everyone built stories that he wouldn't be able to win that way.<br /><br /><br /><br />This season Kevin Durant teamed up with him after losing to Curry and the Warriors the previous years. The narratve then changed quickly, everyone felt as if it wasn't fair for so much talent to be on one team. I can say the Warriors led by Curry proved everyone right, this year they tore the league apart and it looked easy as they did it. He would go on to win a second championship with Golden State and managed to average <i>25.3 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 6.6 apg, 1.8 spg, 47% fg, 41% 3p.</i> This still wouldn't be year everyone have him the respect he rightfully deserved, people thought that he only won due to playing with Kevin Durant, despite averaging more than him that season. But soon he would have a year where people would have no choice but accept his talent.<br /><br /><br /> Once again here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/l1LjtXGjK3g">video</a> of his best plays for this season.</p>

<p><img src="Images/CurryStepBack.jpg" alt="Steph Curry Step Back" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The 2021-22 NBA Season would be Currys best year in my opinion. He was no longer playing with Durant and the world felt that without him and due to Currys injuries he would never make it back to the Finals or win again. But after battling with injuries he came back better then ever, still scoring just as well as he did before. However, now he added the ability to score anywhere on the floor and not just behind the arc, he also became a great defender.<br /><br /><br />This season would be tough on the Warriors since Klay Thompson, the seond leading scorer (behind Curry) would be injured for most of it. Even with the setbacks, Currys elevated game would lead the Warriors back to the Finals this year where he would win his fourth and most recent championship. He averaged <i>25.5 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 6.3 apg, 1.3 spg, 44% fg, 38% 3p.</i><br /><br /><br />This would also be the year Curry broke Ray Allens record for All-Time 3-pointers made, he maneged to do this in almost half the amount of games as well. This year he was also named an NBA All-Star, and he was awarded the Finals MVP. <br /><br /><br /> In honor of his greatness here is a great <a href="https://youtu.be/IaFLdX9DTg4">video</a> of his highlights from this season.</p>
